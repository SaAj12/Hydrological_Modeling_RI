# Hydrological Modeling — Rhode Island


A web platform currently showing USGS flow stations, NOAA tide/water-level stations, and sensor locations. Users can click a station on the map or pick one from dropdown menus to see time series data, including discharge, water level, VTEC (NWS standard format used to encode and track watches, warnings, and advisories (WWAs), precipitation, and other meteorological data. Some meteorological data are still being uploaded. 

For stations where data are not yet available, the map and charts will appear once the uploads are complete.
